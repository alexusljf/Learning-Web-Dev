        <p class = "notes">
            <span style = "color: red; text-decoration: underline"> Notes </span> <br>
            :hover is a pseudo-class, adds extra styles in a certain situation <br>
            :active is when we click on the element <br>
            Transition takes 2 properties: what we want to transition, and how long we want it to take <br>
            Box-shadow takes 4 values: horizontal(to the right), vertical(downwards), blur and the colour <br>
            rgba has a 4th value, the opacity <br>
            Border-radius around half of smaller of height and width to get really rounded corners <br>
