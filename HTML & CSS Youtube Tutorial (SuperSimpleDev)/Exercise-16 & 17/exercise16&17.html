    <h1> Lesson 16 & 17! </h1>
    <h2> Position Absolute and Relative </h2>
    <p style = "border-style: solid; display: inline-block">
        <span style = "color: red; text-decoration: underline;"> Notes (16) </span> <br>
        .className are Class Selectors, elementName{} are Element Selectors <br>
        Can target multiple class together using , <br>
        .searchBar .toolTip to target the .toolTip class inside, don't need unique names for every tool-tip element <br>
        .sidebar-link img{} is targeting all img in .sidebar-link <br>
        justify-content:center and align-items: center can align horizontally and vertically <br>
        Use Position to create tool-tips (position at bottom right), it's just there but hidden when not hovered over <br>
        Opacity 0 -> 1 to hide and show tool-tips, can also use transitions for this <br>
        pointer-events: none to disable hovers on tool-tips; <br>
        whitespace: nowrap to prevent text from wrapping around <br>
        <br>
        <span style = "color: red; text-decoration: underline;"> Notes (17) </span> <br>
            Responsive design makes sure the website looks good on different window sizes <br>
            @media (max-width: 600px){} is a media query, the CSS here will only activate when max-width > 600px <br>
            CSS Specificity: if multiple styles are put on an element, the more specific element will take precedence
