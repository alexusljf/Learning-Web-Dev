            Hello! I'm Alexus!
        </h1>
        <article style = "line-height: 1.6; ">
            I'm pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science at Nanyang Technological University Singapore. <br>
            I am deeply interested in how computer programs work. My interest started from a young age, when I wondered how simple inputs on my mouse and keyboard were able to translate to actions in video games. I watched a few introductory coding tutorials on YouTube and decided that this was something I wanted to pursue. <br>            
            I don't have any work experience relevant to this field yet but I am keen to do internships, learn more and improve myself! <br>
